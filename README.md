# user_access_control
 This provides device(mac) and time based access control to wifi.

This code is based on luci-access-control by k-szuster at the github - https://github.com/k-szuster/luci-access-control.

I have addded the ability to create user and associate devices with a particular user and then the access rules can be created.
